[zeppelin-solidity](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity),
an Ethereum development environment, Ethereum test tools and Ethereum smart contract library.
Please install Truffle, Ganache-cli and zeppelin-solidity before start
```bash
npm install -g truffle
npm install -g ganache-cli
```

```bash
cd  themis-chains-contract/smartsolidity

start ganache-cli
```bash
ganache-cli
